10)How to pack a structure?

We can pack any structure using __attribute__((__packed__)) in gcc. Example -

typdef struct A __attribute __((__packed__))
{
char c;
int i;
}B;

We can also use, pragma pack like this -

#pragma pack(1)
typedef struct A
{ 
char c;
int I;
}B;

In both cases the size of the structure will be 5. But remember, the pragma pack and the other method mentioned, both are compiler dependent.
