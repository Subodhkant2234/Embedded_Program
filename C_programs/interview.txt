11) How to convert a string to integer value?

We can convert a string to integer in two ways. Method 1:

int i = atoi(str);

Method 2:

sscanf(str, “%d”, &i);

14) Which is better #define or enum?

    Enum values can be automatically generated by compiler if we let it. But all the define values are to be mentioned specifically.
    Macro is preprocessor, so unlike enum which is a compile time entity, source code has no idea about these macros. So, the enum is better if we use a debugger to debug the code.
    If we use enum values in a switch and the default case is missing, some compiler will give a warning.
    Enum always makes identifiers of type int. But the macro let us choose between different integral types.
    Macro does not specifically maintain scope restriction unlike enum. For example -

#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
{
#define A 10
printf("first A: %d\n", A);
}
{
printf("second A: %d\n", A);
}
}

What is the default function call method?
By default the functions are called by value.

Is there a way to compare two structure variables?
There is no such. We need to compare element by element of the structure variables.

What are enumerations?
Enumerations are list of integer constants with name. Enumerators are defined with the keyword enum.

What is typecasting?
Typecasting is a way to convert a variable/constant from one type to another type.

What is recursion?
Function calling itself is called as recursion.

What is a self-referential structure?
A structure containing the same structure pointer variable as its element is called as self-referential structure.

What is the purpose of the keyword typedef?
It is used to alias the existing type. Also used to simplify the complex declaration of the type.

What is a preprocessor?
Preprocessor is a directive to the compiler to perform certain things before the actual compilation process begins.
