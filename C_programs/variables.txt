A global variable is variable that can be accessed throughout the program and changes made to global variable persist, while the local variable can be used within a block where it is declared.

Example program for global variable in C:

    The scope of global variables will be throughout the program. These variables can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
    This variable is defined outside the main function. So that, this variable is visible to main function and all other sub functions.

A global variable is a variable that is declared outside all functions. A local variable can only be used in the function where it is declared. A global variable can be used in all functions.
