Enumeration (or enum) is a user defined data type in C. It is mainly used to assign names to integral constants, the names make a program easy to read and maintain.

The keyword ‘enum’ is used to declare new enumeration types in C and C++. Following is an example of enum declaration.

enum State {Working = 1, Failed = 0}; 

Following are some interesting facts about initialization of enum.



Enum vs Macro
We can also use macros to define names constants. For example we can define ‘Working’ and ‘Failed’ using following macro.
#define Working 0
#define Failed 1
#define Freezed 2

There are multiple advantages of using enum over macro when many related named constants have integral values.
a) Enums follow scope rules.
b) Enum variables are automatically assigned values. Following is simpler
enum state  {Working, Failed, Freezed};
